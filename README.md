# Morse_Verilog_Project
This morse project is coded by using Xilinx ISE and Verilog programming language.Also this program receives two inputs(two bits 00 ,01,10 and 11) 
by using test_bench file.In normally case ,the morse program receives one input  from time to time.Bu I haven't  done this way.Because I doesn't
know Verilog syntax very well.Good luck.
